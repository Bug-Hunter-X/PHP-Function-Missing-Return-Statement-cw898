# PHP Function Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: a missing `return` statement in a function that is declared to return a value.  The function `calculateSum` is intended to calculate the sum of an array of numbers, but it omits the `return $sum;` statement. This results in an implicit `NULL` being returned, which can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the function's return value is used in calculations or comparisons.

The solution demonstrates how to fix this error by adding the missing `return` statement.
